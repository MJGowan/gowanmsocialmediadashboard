//Social Media Dashboard
//With the assets given to you remake the following Project - Social Media Dashboard
//Goal is to recreate this challenge as close to the design as possible and having it function properly.
//Tried adding props into the project and struggled to add multiple separate props, so I went with the route of putting everything in one prop
//Peer reviewed by Marcel - The application looks really nice. The dark mode works and everything is responsive. My only critique is that the toggle switch doesnâ€™t change color, but other than that It is really good! Great Job!
